# g3nAR (MVP, TDD scaffold)

Open-source WebAR scaffold for a magazine with QR → tracked video overlays (mind-ar-js compatible). This repo is test-first and ships with unit, integration, and e2e harnesses.

## Quick start
```bash
npm i
npm run dev
# visit http://localhost:5173/art/sample
```

## Add your first artwork
1. Put your target file (the exact print image crop) at `public/targets/sample.mind` (generated by mind-ar image compiler).
2. Put your video loop at `public/media/sample.mp4` (H.264, muted).
3. Optional meta: `public/meta/sample.json` with `{ "aspect": 1.3333 }`.

## Scripts
- `npm test` — unit tests + coverage
- `npm run test:integration` — integration tests (happy-dom)
- `npm run e2e` — Playwright E2E (Chromium/WebKit)
- `npm run verify:content` — ensure every .mind has a matching .mp4

## Notes
- This scaffold mocks the tracker for tests and basic UI. In production, wire MindAR (mind-ar-js) in `src/ar/tracker.ts` to drive the Three.js overlay and replace the mock `triggerFound()` with real target events.
- Serve over HTTPS in production to access the camera.
